## Guessing Number
### Description
- Write a Java program that plays the game I am thinking of a number between 1and 1000. 
- The computer will think of the number, and the user will repeatedly guess until they answer correctly. 
- The program will tell the user if guesses are too high or too low. 
- When the user guesses the correct number, the game should show the user how many turns it took. 
- You must handle incorrect input (letters when numbers were wanted).
